<h2>Description:</h2>
<p>My task is to implement a sorting algorithm. The input data is a one-dimensional array of numbers, which is written through a comma and can be run as follows</p> 

<h2>Requirements:</h2>
<p>The code must be able to sort in ascending order. and descending<br>
The result should display:<br>
1)the name of the algorithm<br>
2)work time<br>
3)the number of comparison operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm<br>
4)the number of exchange operations that were performed during the operation of the algorithm<br>
5)sorting results</p>

<h2>Design:</h2>
<p>MergeSort:<br>
execution time: 23ms<br>
Comparisons: 2000<br>
Swaps: 3000<br>
-9,1,2,11,45,56,78</p>

<h2>Installation:</h2>
<p>Type "python3 -m unittest test_merge_sort.py" in terminal</p>
