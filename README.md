<p>Search in width</p>

<p>Your task will be to implement a width search algorithm to specify the oriented graph and the starting vertex s. The results of the algorithm should be the length of the path (the number of edges to be traversed) from the vertex to the farthest vertex (which can still be achieved with vertices s).</p>

<h1>Installation:</h1>
<p>Type "python3 -m unittest test_merge_sort.py" in terminal</p>
